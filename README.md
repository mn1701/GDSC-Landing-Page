# GDSU Landing Page Submission - by Minh Nguyen

## Running the Application

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: You can download Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: Node Package Manager comes with Node.js, so it should be installed automatically.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the project repository from your preferred version control platform (e.g., GitHub). Use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mn1701/GDSC-Landing-Page.git
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd GDSC-Landing-Page
```


### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies for the project:

```bash
npm install
```

This will read the `package.json` file and install all the required libraries and packages.

### Step 4: Start the Development Server

After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server with the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will start the application and open it in your default web browser. By default, the app will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000/`.

### Step 5: Access the Application

Once the server is running, open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:3000/
```

This should load your application in the browser.
